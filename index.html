    <!-- "what you do" section*About SVG Files
This is XML, which is like a cousin to HTML. Unlike PNGs or JPGs, which are made up of pixels, SVGs (or Scalable Vector Graphics) are defined as a series of points and lines (the <path> elements you see in the XML) that are filled in with color. SVG images can accommodate basically any screen size without losing quality because the graphics will scale. That makes SVGs perfect for things like icons and logos.

In the first <div> under the <h2>What You Do</h2> heading, add the following <img> element: -->
    <section id="what-you-do">
      <h2>What You Do</h2>
